# Overview

Hello and welcome to this README file for my "Hello World" project in C# using Visual Studio!

Important! Do not say in this section that this is a college assignment. Instead, I will talk about what I am trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further my learning.

As a software engineer, I am always looking to improve my skills and expand my knowledge. With this project, I am aiming to get more familiar with C# and the Visual Studio development environment, as well as practice good programming habits such as writing clean and readable code.

The purpose of this software is simple: it is a "Hello World" program that prints out the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. This is a common first program for many developers and serves as a great starting point for learning a new language or development environment.

To showcase my project, I have created a one minute demonstration video on YouTube. In this video, I provide a walkthrough of the code and show the program running. You can check out the video here:

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Microsoft Visual Studio, which is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Windows-based systems. Visual Studio provides a rich set of tools for developing, testing, and deploying applications. It has an intuitive user interface, a powerful code editor, and debugging and profiling tools that help to simplify and accelerate the software development process.

In addition to Visual Studio, I also used the .NET Framework, which is a software framework developed by Microsoft that supports building and running applications on Windows. The .NET Framework provides a large library of pre-built components and features that can be used to develop a wide variety of applications.

As for the programming language, I used C#. C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET Framework. It is a high-level language that is easy to learn and has many features that make it well-suited for developing a wide range of applications, including desktop and mobile applications, web applications, and games. Some of the key features of C# include strong typing, automatic memory management, and support for modern programming paradigms such as functional programming and asynchronous programming.
