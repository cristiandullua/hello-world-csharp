# Overview

Hello and welcome to this README file for my "Hello World" project in C# using Visual Studio Code and ASP.NET Core!

As a software engineer, I am always looking to improve my skills and expand my knowledge. With this project, I aim to get more familiar with ASP.NET Core, C#, and the Visual Studio development environment, as well as practice good programming habits such as writing clean and maintainable code.

The purpose of this project is simple: it is a basic "Hello World" web application that displays the phrase "Hello, World!" in the browser. This is a common first web project for many developers and serves as a great starting point for learning web development in ASP.NET Core.

To showcase my project, I have created a one-minute demonstration video on YouTube. In this video, I provide a walkthrough of the code and show the web application running. You can check out the video here:

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code, a lightweight but powerful source code editor. Visual Studio Code is cross-platform and widely used for web development, making it ideal for developing ASP.NET Core applications.

In addition to Visual Studio Code, I used the .NET Core SDK, specifically ASP.NET Core, which is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. ASP.NET Core allows developers to build web applications and services with ease.

For the programming language, I used C#. C# is a modern, object-oriented language that works seamlessly with ASP.NET Core. It provides a great balance of simplicity and power, making it ideal for building web applications. Some of the key features of ASP.NET Core include middleware support, dependency injection, and the ability to build and deploy to cloud services like Azure.
